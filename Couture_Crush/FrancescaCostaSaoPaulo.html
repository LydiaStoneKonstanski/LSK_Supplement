    <h2>Crushing On: Francesca Costa's Sun-Drenched São Paulo Retreat</h2>
      <p>Nestled in the vibrant heart of Brazil's most dynamic city, Francesca Costa's São Paulo retreat is a stunning sanctuary of elegance and tranquility.

Costa has created a home that is both a serene escape and a celebration of the city's rich cultural tapestry. Her sanctuary is a masterclass in design, where every corner exudes warmth, charm, and an effortless sense of style.<br>
      Costa's São Paulo retreat is bathed in sunlight, thanks to its strategic use of large windows and open spaces that invite the outside in. The living areas are designed to maximize natural light, with floor-to-ceiling glass doors that open onto lush, tropical gardens. These green spaces not only provide a picturesque backdrop but also create a seamless connection between the interior and the exterior, enhancing the sense of openness and freedom. Inside, a neutral color palette of soft whites, sandy beiges, and earth tones is punctuated with vibrant pops of color from local artwork and carefully selected décor pieces, reflecting the lively spirit of São Paulo.<br>
      The retreat's design is a harmonious blend of modernity and tradition. Costa has skillfully incorporated local materials and artisanal craftsmanship into the contemporary framework of the home. Handcrafted wooden furniture, intricate tilework, and natural stone accents lend an authentic Brazilian touch to the sleek, minimalist architecture. The result is a space that feels both timeless and contemporary, rooted in its cultural context yet universally appealing. From the cozy, sun-drenched reading nook to the inviting al fresco dining area, Francesca Costa redefines casual cool, invites relaxation, and inspires admiration. It's a perfect example of how thoughtful design can transform a home into a personal paradise.</p><br>

    <h3>Conversational Q&A:</h3>
      <p><strong>Isa:</strong><em>You have headed iconic fashion houses in large cities around the world. What inspired you to settle in São Paulo?</em><br>
      <strong>Francesca:</strong> São Paulo is my home, where I was raised in good measure by grandmother, so naturally I drew inspiration from the vibrant culture and natural beauty of Brazil. I wanted to create a space that blends contemporary elegance with local traditions, using natural materials and a design that maximizes sunlight and open spaces. No matter where I move, this is home for me.<br>
      <strong>Isa:</strong><em>The light here is truly amazing. How did you make the most of it?</em><br>
          <strong>Francesca:</strong><em>(laughs)</em> Thanks to my inspired architect Rafael Menezes! He urged me to commission these large bronze frame custom windows and floor-to-ceiling glass doors that open onto tropical gardens. It took the longest, but it was worth the wait! I love how seamless is the connection between the indoors and outdoors. It is so tranquil. The house is situated to take advantage of the light, but stay cool in the midday sun and draw a lovely breeze.<br>
      <strong>Isa:</strong><em>What are some standout features of the interiors for you?</em><br>
      <strong>Francesca:</strong>The handcrafted wooden furniture was really important to me, intricate tilework, and natural stone accents. These elements reflect local craftsmanship are what Brazil is about to me.<br>
      <strong>Isa:</strong><em>What was your creative process like?</em><br>
      <strong>Francesca:</strong>Very collaborative! We started with a minimalist neutral color palette of white and neutral tones mixed with the green of plants to project a calming energy, but you know me! I can’t resist vibrant pops of color! We sourced works from some amazing local artists and colorful traditional textiles that add energy and reflect the lively spirit of São Paulo.<br>
      <strong>Isa:</strong><em>What is the significance of the outdoor spaces in your design?</em><br>
      <strong>Francesca:</strong>I want to lose track of what is the the interior and the garden. Otherwise what’s the use of the tropical climate? Don’t let all this fool you *here Francesca gestures to herself in a flawless mix of vintage couture and her own current designs* I am a barefoot woman at heart.<br>
      <strong>Isa:</strong><em>Thank you for making time for my readers! It has been such a privilege to speak with you!</em><br>
      <strong>Francesca:</strong>Francesca: The pleasure is all mine, Isabelle.</p>
