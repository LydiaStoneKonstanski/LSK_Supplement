-- SELECT *
-- FROM state_climate LIMIT 5;
--1) Inspect table

-- SELECT state, year, tempf, tempc,
-- AVG(tempf) OVER(
--   PARTITION BY state
--   ORDER BY year
-- ) AS 'running_avg_temp'
-- FROM state_climate;
--2) Now letâ€™s explore the lowest temperatures for each state.

-- SELECT state, year, tempf, tempc,
--   FIRST_VALUE(tempf) OVER (
--     PARTITION BY state
--     ORDER BY tempf
--   ) AS 'lowest_temp'
--   FROM state_climate;
--3) The above returns lowest temp, with rows for every year.

-- SELECT state, year, tempf, tempc
-- FROM state_climate
-- WHERE tempf = (
--     SELECT MIN(tempf)
--     FROM state_climate AS 'sc'
--     WHERE sc.state = state_climate.state)
-- ORDER BY tempf;
--3) The above returns a table with each of the 50 states labeled, and the lowest
avg temp year listed with its' value, ordered by the lower of the avg temps to highest
of the avg temps.

-- SELECT state, year, tempf
-- FROM state_climate
-- WHERE state =='West Virginia';
--checking because the next returns 2 west virgina numbers, but it should be WV year 1921, 54.31666667. Turns out, that number comes up in both 1921 and 2012

-- SELECT state, year, tempf, tempc
-- FROM state_climate
-- WHERE tempf = (
--     SELECT MAX(tempf)
--     FROM state_climate as 'sc'
--     WHERE sc.state = state_climate.state)
-- ORDER BY tempf DESC;
--4) The above returns a table with each of the 50 states labeled, and the highest
avg temp year listed with its' value, ordered by the lower of the avg temps to highest of the avg temps.

-- SELECT state, year, tempf, tempc
-- FROM state_climate
-- WHERE tempf = (
--     SELECT MAX(tempf)
--     FROM state_climate AS 'sc'
--     WHERE sc.state = state_climate.state)
-- ORDER BY year DESC;
--4) The above ordering by year shows that the recorded hottest averages by state
are overwhelmingly within recent years.

-- SELECT state, year, tempf,
--   COALESCE(ABS(tempf - LAG(tempf) OVER(
--     PARTITION BY state
--     ORDER BY year
--   )), 0) AS change_in_temp
-- FROM state_climate
-- ORDER BY change_in_temp DESC;

--5) This query shows changes in temp from the previous year, and orders by largest swing.
The Northern US saw the largest changes. Which dates range greatly, but 2013 was major.

-- SELECT RANK() OVER(
--     ORDER BY tempf ASC
--   ) AS ranked_coldest,
--   state,
--   year,
--   tempf
-- FROM state_climate;
--6) Returns the RANK of coldest temperatures on record for any state or year.
You really don't want to live in ND. The colder years are in the past.

-- SELECT
--   RANK() OVER(
--     ORDER BY MAX(tempf) DESC) AS ranked_warmest,
--   state,
--   MAX(tempf) AS warmest_avg_temp
-- FROM state_climate
-- GROUP BY state;
--7) Warmest_rank/state: Altogether the south and particularly Florida returns the highest rank,
followed by Louisiana. Overall, more recent dates rank higher.

-- SELECT
--   NTILE(4) OVER(
--   ORDER BY MIN(tempf) ASC) AS 'quartile',
--   state,
--   MIN(tempf) AS coldest_avg_temp
-- FROM state_climate
-- GROUP BY state;
--8) quartile, year, state, tempf, tempc with top quartile = coldest year.
Top Quartile: ND, MN, MA, MT, VT, WY, WI, NH, MI, ID, SD, NY

-- SELECT
--   NTILE(5) OVER(
--   ORDER BY AVG(tempf) ASC) AS 'quintile',
--   state,
--   year,
--   AVG(tempf) AS coldest_year_temp
-- FROM state_climate
-- GROUP BY state;

WITH yearly_avg_temps AS (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG(tempf) AS avg_temp
    FROM state_climate
    GROUP BY year
), quintiles AS (
    SELECT
        year,
        avg_temp,
        NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY avg_temp ASC) AS quintile  -- Coldest years get lowest quintile
    FROM yearly_avg_temps
)
SELECT
    q.quintile,
    s.year,
    s.state,
    s.tempf
FROM state_climate s
JOIN quintiles q ON s.year = q.year
ORDER BY q.quintile, s.year;

--9) top quintile should be coldest overall, not by state. This rates
1895, 1899, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1907, 1912, 1916, 1917, 1920, 1924, 1926, 1929,
1940, 1950, 1958, 1960, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1972, 1976, 1978, and 1979 as the first quintile years.
The thing that is different about this showing is that this shows every state average for the year,
but its the years that are ranked.
