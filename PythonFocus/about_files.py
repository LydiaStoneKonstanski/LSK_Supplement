'''If we had something called real_cool_document.txt with these contents: Wowsers!
We could read that file like this:

with open('real_cool_document.txt') as cool_doc:
  cool_contents = cool_doc.read()
print(cool_contents)

This opens a file object called cool_doc and creates a new indented block
where you can read the contents of the opened file. We then read the contents
of the file cool_doc using cool_doc.read() and save the resulting string into
the variable cool_contents. Then we print cool_contents, which outputs the
statement Wowsers!

'''.READ() puts everything in one line'''
with open('welcome.txt') as text_file:

'''.READLINES() shows lines as individuals'''

  for line in lines_doc.readlines():
    print(line)

# 1. How many lines do we write on the daily,

# 2. Many money, we write many many many
#
# 3. How many lines do you write on the daily,
#

'''Writing to a file
With opens and closes the file. If you don't use with you must use close()

The second argument is to write file. The default is 'r' for read.

If the file name exists already 'w' will overwrite the file. 
'a' appends to the file instead of overwriting.
